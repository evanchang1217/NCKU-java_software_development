NCKU-java_software_development
This repository contains the final project for the 2024 NCKU Java Software Development course. The project is a Tetris game implemented in Java, featuring two gameplay modes:
Standard Mode – The classic Tetris experience where players aim for the highest score by clearing lines.

40-Line Challenge Mode – A time-based challenge where players must clear 40 lines as quickly as possible.

The game is developed with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and follows best practices in Java development.
